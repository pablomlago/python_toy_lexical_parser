      *Before the first line of the file is read, a single zero is pushed on the stack; this will never be popped off again.
      *The numbers pushed on the stack will always be strictly increasing from bottom to top. At the beginning of each logical
      *line, the lineâ€™s indentation level is compared to the top of the stack. If it is equal, nothing happens. If it is larger,
      *it is pushed on the stack, and one INDENT token is generated. If it is smaller, it must be one of the numbers occurring
      *on the stack; all numbers on the stack that are larger are popped off, and for each number popped off a DEDENT token is
      *generated. At the end of the file, a DEDENT token is generated for each number remaining on the stack that is larger than zero.*/
